# Simple and Multiple Regression-Model
We consider the modelling between the dependent and one independent variable. When there is only one
independent variable in the linear regression model, the model is generally termed as a simple linear
regression model. When there are more than one independent variables in the model, then the linear model
is termed as the multiple linear regression model.

Regression analysis is a well-known statistical learning technique useful to infer the relationship between a dependent variable Y and p independent variables X=[X1|…|Xp]. The dependent variable Y is also known as response variable or outcome, and the variables Xk (k=1,…,p) as predictors, explanatory variables, or covariates.

More precisely, regression analysis aims to estimate the mathematical relation f() for explaining Y in terms of X as, Y=f(X),

using the observations (xi,Yi),i=1,…,n, collected on n observed statistical units.

Y = β0 + β1 x + ε

Y= Dependent Variable/ Response Variable /Outcome

X= Independent Variable / Predictors

β0 = Intercept

β1 = Slope ε = Error Term
